# Importing Scripts into a Scene
To import a script into a Scene, first make a new script playlist from the Text Card by clicking the `+` in the top 
right of the card, and then click the `+` in the new playlsit to add a script from your library. This will bring you to 
a view of your Library with checkboxes next to each script. You can filter and sort this list to assist with locating 
specific files. After you're done selecting the scripts you want, click the `Import` button 
( <img style="vertical-align: -5px" src="doc_icons/import.svg" alt="Import" width="20" height="20"> ).
Your selected scripts will now appear in the playlist. Scripts are added in the order they were selected.

?> **Tip**: Use the _SHIFT_ key to quickly select multiple scripts
